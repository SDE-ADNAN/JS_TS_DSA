## README for `mergeAlternately` function

**Functionality:**

This function takes two strings, `word1` and `word2`, and combines them by interleaving their characters in alternating order. It prioritizes characters from `word1` first and appends any remaining characters from the longer string if one exists.

**Explanation:**

* **Initialization:**
    * Store the lengths of `word1` and `word2` in variables.
    * Calculate the shorter of the two lengths (`min`).
    * Create an empty string `result` to hold the merged string.
* **Interleaving Characters (Loop):**
    * Iterate through a loop from 0 to `min - 1`, appending characters from `word1` and `word2` at each index to `result`.
* **Handling Unequal Lengths:**
    * After the loop, check if the lengths are equal:
        * If equal, return the `result` as it already contains the merged string.
        * If unequal, append the remaining characters from the longer string to `result`.
* **Returning the Merged String:**
    * Return the final `result` string.

**Example:**

For `word1 = "abc"` and `word2 = "defg"`, the function returns "adeg".

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes lowercase English letters only.
* Time complexity is O(min), but can be improved to O(max(length1, length2)).
* Consider error handling for empty strings or non-lowercase characters.
* Refactoring with string interpolation and ternary operators is possible.
* The function's purpose could be generalized for different content or starting string choice.
